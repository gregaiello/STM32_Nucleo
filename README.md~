STM32_Nucleo

Linker and Start up code modified to make the Nucleo board with the STM32F413ZHT6 microcontroller work fine with:
-arm-none-eabi toolchain
-stlink

In order to download the file on the board:
1- Download and extract the folder
2- Run 'make all' from a terminal
3- run 'make flash' with your Nucleo board connected to a USB port

This is a simple project with the only aim to check the modified linker and startup scripts.
